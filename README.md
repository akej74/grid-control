### Highlights
- Simple to use and resource efficient
- Written in Python 3 using QT5 for the user interface
- Uses OpenHardwareMonitor to read sensor values
- Individual fan control (manual or automatic with control points)
- Support the Grid+ V2 device

### Disclaimer
NZXT is not involved in this project, do not contact them if your device is damaged while using this software.

Also, while it doesn't seem like the hardware could be damaged by silly USB messages (apart from overheating), I do **NOT** take any responsibility for any damage done to your cooler.

### Experimental Kraken X61 support
Release 1.0.3 adds experimental support for the Kraken X61 cooler. This requires the [LibUSB](http://libusb.info/) library to be installed, see next chapter.

### LibUSB installation - IMPORTANT!
1. To be able to communicate whith the Kraken X61 USB device, you need to download pre-compiled LibUSB DLL's from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.20/libusb-1.0.20.7z/download)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Assuming you are using a **64 bit** version of windows:
 - Copy ...\libusb-1.0.20\MS32\dll\libusb-1.0.dll to C:\Windows\SysWOW64
 - Copy ...\libusb-1.0.20\MS64\dll\libusb-1.0.dll to C:\Windows\System32
 - Yes, the 64-bit DLL should be copied to "System32", and the 32-bit version to "SysWOW64" :-)

### Stand-alone installation
Grid Control is available as a stand-alone application (Python does not need to be installed):
- Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/akej74/grid-control/releases)
- Unzip file
- Run "gridcontrol.exe"

### OpenHardwareMonitor
Grid Control uses [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor) to get temperature information from the available sensors in the system.
- Download latest release of OpenHardwareMonitor [here](http://openhardwaremonitor.org/files/openhardwaremonitor-v0.7.1.5-alpha.zip)

### Driver for the Grid device
The Grid uses a MCP2200 USB-to-UART serial converter from [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en546923).

Driver installation:
- Windows 10
 - No driver is needed, Windows 10 will detect the Grid device automatically and add a "USB Serial Device" in Device Manager
 
- Windows 7
 - A driver is needed, see "MCP2200/MCP2221 Windows Driver & Installer" on the [product page](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en546923)
 
### Python environment
Assuming you have Python 3 installed, the following additional modules are required (can be installed with "pip").
- pip install pyserial
- pip install wmi
- pip install pypiwin32
- pip install pyqt5

### QT Creator
QT Creator (including QT Designer for UI design) can be downloaded [here](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/).

### Grid simulator
For troubleshooting, or if you would like to run Grid Control without a Grid device, please have a look at my grid simulator available [here](https://github.com/akej74/grid-simulator).
 
### Inspiration from other projects
I would like to thank the authors of the following projects that have been helpful in understanding the communication protocol the Grid uses.
